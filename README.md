| **Continuous**   | Regression     | Dimentionality Reduction |

> ### Reinforcement Learning
- An area of Machine Learning concerned with how machine learning agents ought to take action in an environment so as to maximize a specific outcome. 

**Example**

So when you are teaching a two-year-old about different animals hey this is a cat and this is a dog and this is a cow and they may have a picture book in fornt of them.Then you get them out to and actual barnyard and they see a cow for the first time they look at you and be like cow? (asking) .  you're going to say " Yeah , honey that's a cow" . That reinforces it for that child and they learn what a cow is. 

 *Wonderful example by the instructor* **Alyssa Simpson Rohwerger** 

You can read about reinforcement learning in this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot) "Twitter bot")
- Human in the Loop (HITL) refers to having a human-moderator or data annotator that can help with quality control of a product.

## **FAQ** :
-  In the comparison between supervised and unsupervised learning they mentioned Dimensionality Reduction which is continuous and unsupervised. But I can not understand the term Dimensionality Reduction and what it means.
    - Ans: I am working in a gaming company. In order to analyse churn of a player, there are many dimensions (parameters) which plays a role in churn of a customer. Let's say difficulty of the level, Loading speed, whether advertisement is there or not, whether it is repetitive, etc... There may be 20-30 dimensions with which the churn will be based on. But if you see correlation of churn and every dimentions, for many dimentions, the correlation will be very low. So I'm order to reduce the complexity, we will do dimensionality reduction! 
-  How does dimensionality reduction fall under unsupervised continuous?
    - Ans: As  an approach dimensionality reduction allows us to reduce the features/variables used to model. Simply put it allows us to get to the essence of the data. As Nick stated it can be used in both supervised and unsupervised contexts. However it is used mostly in unsupervised data because the algorithm has no labelled dataset to begin with so we need unsupervised learning to uncover the relationships. Let us know if this makes sense.
- Are dimensionality reduction use to speed up training and make more meaningful model?
    - In some cases the number of dimensions will be very large. I will give you one more real-life example. I am wokring in a gaming company. In order to analyse churn of a player, there are many dimensions (parameters) which plays a role in churn of a customer. Let's say difficulty of the level, Loading speed, whether advertisement is there or not, whether it is repetitive, etc... There may be 20-30 dimensions with which the churn will be based on. But if you see correlation of churn and every dimentions, for many dimentions, the correlation will be very low. So I'm order to reduce the complexity, we will do dimensionality reduction thereby increasing the processing speed mainly!
    - It's interesting you mention a meaningful model. In most cases a model using dimensional transformation will be less explainable than one using the raw features. This is because the composite features generated may not easily correspond to real values. As an example, consider a case where you're looking to forecast house price based on a number of features, including # of rooms, # sq ft, # total rooms. There is likely a correlation between these values so these three features could be reduced into a single dimension which is less interpretable
-  What is 'weights'  and threshold.  If you can give examples of weights and threshold it will be great!
    - Ans: weights are actually parameters which define the strength of the connection between units.For example, here "Am I free" has more weightage for our decision to go to a work colleague's party

## **Lesson 3: Using AI and Machine Learning in Business**

> ### Overview

Applications of AI
- Face recognition
- Retail inventory management
- E-commerce search relevance
- Customer support automation
- Data categorization/classification
- Agricultural automation
- Manufacturing efficiency and quality control
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Sentiment analysis of social media posts/mentions

> ### AI Approach

- Data Ingestion -> Data Cleaning & Transformation -> Model Training -> Testing and Validation -> Model Selection -> Model Training (Loop) ->Testing and Validation(Loop)->Deployment

**An approach that realizes business value starts with the problem**

Step-1
- Business Problem
    - Definition , value , stakeholders , priority, investment

Notes:
- Hardest part


Step-2

- Data
    - Availability, provenance, security, coverage, cleaning, augmentation, annotation, refreshing, pipeline development

Step-3
- Model Building
    - Feature extraction, hyperparameters, tuning, selection, benchmarking

Step-4
- Deploy & Measure
    - Business value measurement, AB testing, versioning, business process integration

Step-5
- Active Learning & Tuning
    - Bias mitigation, ground truth & success monitoring, version control

> ### Business Needs

- Business needs drive data needs, not the other way around

Example

 *Starting with data is like trying to pack your suitcase when you don't know where you're going or for how long.*

- Production systems actively learn from humans 
- You will need human in the loop process to give feedback to your model

> ### The Business Case

- The business problem for adobe is find the right image for customer fast.
- As a product manager it is important to write down all possible steps and try to clarify what each step is trying to accomplish.

Sequential steps to use computer vision to accomplish the task of improving conversion:(Not the only way)
- Generate appropriate search query
- Enter search query
- Apply filters to narrow results
- Identify images with the corresponding visual aesthetic qualities.

Another tool:
- Identifying the AI value and spending time writing down the details what actively needs to be accomplished by that user.
- This also helps you identify what data is needed to accomplish a specific task.

> ### Project Statement

- What problem are we solving? We are helping marketers find the right stock images for marketing collateral, in order to improve conversion and sales.

- How does AI add value? It can tag images with the right qualities, thus making image search more efficient.

- What data are needed? Stock images tagged with aesthetic qualities.

- Scope? When I need to find a stock photo for marketing colateral, I want to select the best option on all variables so I can improve ad conversion and sales.

- How do we measure success? Users can find the best stock image quickly.

> ### Breaking it All Down
- Narrowing the business problem: break it down

One ecommerce problem:

- Improve site conversion
- Improve search results
- Improve click throught on top 10 search results returned
- Improve % of hero images which feature the product

Another ecommerce problem:

- Improve customer experience & repeat customer business
- Improve store experience
- Improve % of shelves fully stocked at 100%
- Understand which products are under-stocked
- Delineate between stocked and empty shelves and identify products missing

Using AI in business :
- Deploy for targeted use cases
    - To realize business value, AI technologies must be deployed to deliver specific, measurable business outcomes for targeted use cases.
- Business problem before data
    - It's rarely a good idea to start with a decision to clean up data. It's almost always better to start with a business case and then evaluate options for how to achieve success in that special case.
- Success depends on the data
    - Out AI systems are only as good as the data we put into them.

> ### Metrics
What makes a metric effective?

- Easily measurable
- Directly correlated to business performance
- Predictive of future business outcomes
- Isolated to factors controlled by the group it's measuring.
- Comparable to competitor's metrics

> ### Metrics Quiz

 how would you design a metric to measure the outcome of finding the right stock images?

 - Time spend between searching and purchasing
 - Number of images purchased per user
 - Net Promoter Score (NPS) rating for search results
 - % of stock imagery purchased overall

 All four could be answer. It depends on what's most meaningful for adobe's business.

 > ### Metrics Example: LinkedIn

Improving job search and job listings at Linkedin
- Classified companies by industry
- Improved quality of job recommendations
- Increased collective InMail response rates by 45%
- Total number of continuing, two way conversatoins started in Linkedin Recruiter doubled

( They used NLP for performance increase)

> ### Need for AI

- Not all projects need AI

Key considerations :
- Do you have an impactful business problem that warrants solving?
- Can you quantify the business value clearly and simply?
- Does the problem have a large volume of associated data?

- Is that data well organized and is it complete?

The Data is most critical piece of this problem here.

- How much data do you have?
- Does the dataset match the problem?
- Is the dataset complete?
- Is the data annotated correctly for the ML team? 

**Spending a lot of time actaully looking through your dataset and samples of it in detail is absolutely critical as the product manager**

> ### Need for AI Example

Do we need Tradional Machine Learning approach or Deep Learning approach?
- It really depends on the problem you are solving and the data available to solve that problem.

Need for deep learning vs traditional ML
- Deep learning outperforms with large datasets. ML will worl better with smaller datasets.
- Deep learning techniques will require more powerful infrastructure.
- Deep learning is about learning features rather than manually engineering them
- Deep learning shines when applied to complex/multidimensinal problems: image classification, natural language processing, speech recognition.

You need to think about your data pipeline once you deploy to production.Setting up a data pipeline for training not just once but continiously is super critical for the product long-term success.

Typically versioning or continuous learning can update or improve your model based on new information.

> ### Things to Remember

- Start with the business value
    - Break it down into a small and specific component of the process that you want to improve.
- Get real with the data
    - use production data to ensure that the training data match the reality of the real-world deployment.
- Learning is key to value
    - Learning from new data ensures constant improvement

Customer support use case 
- Autodesk automated their customer service and support using chatbot that uses NLP to interect with customers and help them resetting their password. If it was not password reset the chat was routed to a live support system for resolution.

**There is no magic solution when deploying machine learning technology. It's a mix of keeping humans in the loop and gradually expanding the use case overtime**

> ### Team Overview

Needs of the team:
- Business need

## **FAQ** :
- Does anyone know how the net promoter score works and what it is good for? Thanks in advance.
    - Long story short you can measure the satisfaction of the customers. For example if you range your Net Promoter Score from 1 to 10 , clients in range from 1-3 are considered Detractors and from 7-10 are considered Promoters. The others (4-6) are in the neutral area
    - [What is Net Promoter Score (NPS)? Everything you need to know](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/?rid=ip&prevsite=en&newsite=uk&geo=TR&geomatch=uk "What is Net Promoter Score (NPS)? Everything you need to know")

- I understand the concept of how deep learning improves in accuracy when a model is fed more data-however, how is this different to more traditional  machine learning algorithms? Surely more data is better there as well?
    -  DL has more capability to detect patterns in data since it has multiple layers to process data and grasp features. Whereas, a traditional ML might not detect patterns so successfully although you feed it large amounts of data. So, it can be a waste of computation time.

    - [Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-vs-machine-learning-e0a9cb2f288 "Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning")

- Can somebody enlighten me on the actual worth of the Net Promoter Score metric ? I hear contradicting opinions, some ( research papers) stating that it is not a reliable metric in some cases.
    - Hi! I also think it is a bit tricky. You remember the meme about recommending Windows? :slightly_smiling_face: There was an awesome reply that people don't recommend operating systems to each other in regular conversations. It's true for NPS as well. I'm not going to promote a company among my friends just because I like it. Sometimes I do, yes, but very rarely. Maybe when they ask for advice, like which running shoe is the best.
    - Pros: It's easy to measure and highly correlated with business growth. Cons:white_frowning_face:: Doesn't answer the context for the data points 1-10. Also, often too small sample of participants in this (voluntary) survey.
