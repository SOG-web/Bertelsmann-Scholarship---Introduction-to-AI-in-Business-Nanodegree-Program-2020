- What do people mean when they refer to AI ?

*The term AI is a aspirational , a moving target based on those capabilities that human posses but which machine do not* - Zachary Lipton
> ### Why Deep Learning
- Supercomputer measure their performance in FLOPS or calculation per second
- Global data sphere reading at a 175 zettabytes of information.

- Why AI is relevent
    - Compute power
    - Cost
    - Data Availability
- FlOps - floating point operations, which computers use to do any calculation (from storing text to doing multiplication!)
> ### Industry Application

- How will AI effect Industry ?

*I thinks that Ai technology, especially deep learning has now advanced to the point where we see a surprisingly clear path for it to transform every major industry* - Andrew Ng
- Add $15.7 trillion to global economy by 2030 (PWC)
- Labor productivity improvements and product enhancements (PWC)

- Sectors with great potential 
    - Retail : pricing and promotion and customer service management
    - Consumer goods: supply-chain management , demand forecasting
    - Finance : marketing and sales , assesing and managing risk

> ### Affecting Industry

- AI can distinguish between crops and weeds so that only weeds are sprayed , reducing herbicide usage by > 90%

> ### Machine Learning Concepts

 What is Machine Learning ?

*Computer algorithm athat improve automatically through experience* -Tom Mitchell

- Supervised Learning:
    - Classification
    - Regression
- Unsupervised Learnings:
    - Clustering
    - Association
- Reinforcement Learning
    - Real-time
    - Offline

> ### Supervised Learning
- data -> label
- Classification : Categorizing unstructered data into particular categories of class
- Regression : output numerical or continuous
- Supervised Learning use cases
    - Image classification
    - Optical character recognition
    - Face recognition
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Machine Translation
    - Audio Transciption
    - Event Detection
> ### Unsupervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning finds patterns in data
- Unsupervised Learning use cases
    - Cluster customers paths through an ecommerce website

> ### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
- Discrete data is data that you can count and it has a finite amount, say the number of image classes or clothing item types.
- Continuous data is often numerical data that takes a large range of values.
    
|                  | Supervised     | Unsupervised             |
| :---             |    :----:      |  ---:                    |
|**Discreet**      | Classification | Clustering               |
| **Continuous**   | Regression     | Dimentionality Reduction |

> ### Reinforcement Learning
- An area of Machine Learning concerned with how machine learning agents ought to take action in an environment so as to maximize a specific outcome. 

**Example**

So when you are teaching a two-year-old about different animals hey this is a cat and this is a dog and this is a cow and they may have a picture book in fornt of them.Then you get them out to and actual barnyard and they see a cow for the first time they look at you and be like cow? (asking) .  you're going to say " Yeah , honey that's a cow" . That reinforces it for that child and they learn what a cow is. 

 *Wonderful example by the instructor* **Alyssa Simpson Rohwerger** 

You can read about reinforcement learning in this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot) "Twitter bot")
- Human in the Loop (HITL) refers to having a human-moderator or data annotator that can help with quality control of a product.
> ### Neural Networks

- A neural network makes decision based on information.
- Add weights to increase influence of a certain input.
- Weights and threshold determine decision making models .
- Each layer of a neural network makes decision based on the decisions made in the prior layers.

        - Heads-up n-limit hold'em poker
    - Similarly to most humans
        - Optical character recognition
        - Classification of images
        - Handwriting recognition
        - Facial recognition (best algorithm about as good as the best humans in 2018)
    - Worse than most humans
        - Captions & visual descriptions of imagery
        - Various robotics tasks(Stable bipedal locomotion)
        - General speech recognition
        - Complex logical reasoning
        - Tasks that are difficult without contextual knowledge
            - Translation
            - Explainability
            - Self-driving cars 
            - Translation

*We are at the brink of being able to take an AI, [have it] look over our shoulders, and then [it will] make us maybe 10 or 50 times as effective at these repetitive things* - Sebastian Thrun

> ### Outro
**Lesson Summary**
- AI: "The science and engineering of making computers behave in ways that, until recently, we thought required human intelligence."
- Machine learning techniques and terminology such as deep learning, neural neworks, classification, and clustering.
- State of the art AI is powerful and superhuman only in narrow and discrete use cases. It's used in every industry for a wide variety of applications and use cases.

## **FAQ** :
-  In the comparison between supervised and unsupervised learning they mentioned Dimensionality Reduction which is continuous and unsupervised. But I can not understand the term Dimensionality Reduction and what it means.
    - Ans: I am working in a gaming company. In order to analyse churn of a player, there are many dimensions (parameters) which plays a role in churn of a customer. Let's say difficulty of the level, Loading speed, whether advertisement is there or not, whether it is repetitive, etc... There may be 20-30 dimensions with which the churn will be based on. But if you see correlation of churn and every dimentions, for many dimentions, the correlation will be very low. So I'm order to reduce the complexity, we will do dimensionality reduction! 
-  How does dimensionality reduction fall under unsupervised continuous?
    - Ans: As  an approach dimensionality reduction allows us to reduce the features/variables used to model. Simply put it allows us to get to the essence of the data. As Nick stated it can be used in both supervised and unsupervised contexts. However it is used mostly in unsupervised data because the algorithm has no labelled dataset to begin with so we need unsupervised learning to uncover the relationships. Let us know if this makes sense.
- Are dimensionality reduction use to speed up training and make more meaningful model?
    - In some cases the number of dimensions will be very large. I will give you one more real-life example. I am wokring in a gaming company. In order to analyse churn of a player, there are many dimensions (parameters) which plays a role in churn of a customer. Let's say difficulty of the level, Loading speed, whether advertisement is there or not, whether it is repetitive, etc... There may be 20-30 dimensions with which the churn will be based on. But if you see correlation of churn and every dimentions, for many dimentions, the correlation will be very low. So I'm order to reduce the complexity, we will do dimensionality reduction thereby increasing the processing speed mainly!
    - It's interesting you mention a meaningful model. In most cases a model using dimensional transformation will be less explainable than one using the raw features. This is because the composite features generated may not easily correspond to real values. As an example, consider a case where you're looking to forecast house price based on a number of features, including # of rooms, # sq ft, # total rooms. There is likely a correlation between these values so these three features could be reduced into a single dimension which is less interpretable
-  What is 'weights'  and threshold.  If you can give examples of weights and threshold it will be great!
    - Ans: weights are actually parameters which define the strength of the connection between units.For example, here "Am I free" has more weightage for our decision to go to a work colleague's party
